This is an expanded upon version of my end of year project for AP computer science in senior year of high school.

It is a work in progress.

While there are 12 characters, I currently am only uploading 1 to show how the character classes work.

Essentially, the user gets to choose the player's name and gender. The gender determines which characters they can date, as some characters are exclusive to certain genders. For now, the player has 1 school week (5 days) to interact with the characters. If they talk to a character enough and the character is available to the player's gender, they may go on a date with that character.

This is far from finished. Some things I plan on adding are: visuals, a second week, the rest of the characters' dialogue, 2 dates per character, a storyline that starts during the second week, at least 2 different endings per character, and much more!

All of this is my original work. Please ask me if you are considering using any of it.
